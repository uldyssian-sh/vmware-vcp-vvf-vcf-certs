# VCP-VCF Architect (2V0-13.25) - Sample Questions

## Question 1: AMPRS Design Principles
**An organization requires a VCF design that ensures 99.9% uptime and can recover from site failures within 4 hours. Which AMPRS principle is the PRIMARY focus?**

A) Availability  
B) Manageability  
C) Performance  
D) Recoverability  

**Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** While recoverability addresses the 4-hour recovery requirement, the 99.9% uptime requirement is primarily an availability concern that drives the overall design approach.

## Question 2: Business Requirements Analysis
**During a VCF design engagement, the customer states they need "better performance." What should the architect do FIRST?**

A) Recommend all-flash storage  
B) Increase CPU and memory specifications  
C) Define specific performance requirements and metrics  
D) Implement DRS aggressive settings  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Vague requirements like "better performance" must be quantified with specific metrics, baselines, and targets before technical solutions can be designed.

## Question 3: VCF Architecture Components
**Which component is responsible for lifecycle management across the entire VCF stack?**

A) vCenter Server  
B) NSX Manager  
C) SDDC Manager  
D) vRealize Suite  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** SDDC Manager is the central lifecycle management component that orchestrates operations across all VCF components.

## Question 4: Workload Domain Design
**A customer wants to separate development and production workloads in VCF. What is the BEST approach?**

A) Use different clusters in the same workload domain  
B) Create separate workload domains  
C) Use NSX-T micro-segmentation only  
D) Implement different resource pools  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Separate workload domains provide the strongest isolation for different environments, including separate management, networking, and security boundaries.

## Question 5: Risk Assessment
**During VCF design, which factor represents a CONSTRAINT rather than a requirement?**

A) 99.99% availability target  
B) Existing network infrastructure limitations  
C) Compliance with PCI-DSS standards  
D) Support for 500 virtual machines  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Existing infrastructure limitations are constraints that limit design options, while the others are requirements that drive design decisions.

## Question 6: Network Design
**For a VCF deployment requiring network segmentation between different business units, which design approach is MOST appropriate?**

A) VLANs only  
B) NSX-T overlay networks with micro-segmentation  
C) Physical network separation  
D) vSphere distributed switches with port groups  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** NSX-T overlay networks provide software-defined segmentation with micro-segmentation capabilities, which is ideal for multi-tenant environments.

## Question 7: Storage Design
**A VCF design requires 50TB of storage with the ability to lose two disk failures per host. Which vSAN configuration is MOST appropriate?**

A) RAID-1 (FTT=1)  
B) RAID-5 (FTT=1)  
C) RAID-6 (FTT=2)  
D) RAID-1 (FTT=2)  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** RAID-6 with FTT=2 can tolerate two disk failures per host while providing efficient storage utilization for large capacity requirements.

## Question 8: Capacity Planning
**When designing VCF compute capacity, which factor should be considered FIRST?**

A) CPU specifications  
B) Memory requirements  
C) Workload characteristics and requirements  
D) Host hardware compatibility  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Understanding workload characteristics (CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, I/O patterns) is essential before determining specific hardware requirements.

## Question 9: Integration Design
**A customer wants to integrate VCF with their existing backup solution. Which integration point should be considered?**

A) vCenter Server APIs only  
B) SDDC Manager APIs only  
C) Both vCenter and SDDC Manager APIs  
D) Direct ESXi host access  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Comprehensive backup integration requires both vCenter APIs for VM-level operations and SDDC Manager APIs for infrastructure-level backup and recovery.

## Question 10: Design Documentation
**Which document should contain the detailed technical specifications for VCF component sizing?**

A) Conceptual Design  
B) Logical Design  
C) Physical Design  
D) Implementation Plan  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The Physical Design document contains detailed technical specifications, including component sizing, hardware specifications, and configuration details.

## Scenario-Based Question

### Scenario: Global Enterprise VCF Design
**A multinational corporation requires a VCF deployment with the following requirements:**
- Primary site: New York (1000 VMs)
- Secondary site: London (500 VMs)  
- DR requirement: 4-hour RTO, 1-hour RPO
- Compliance: SOX, GDPR
- Network: Existing MPLS between sites
- Budget: $2M for infrastructure

**Question:** What is the PRIMARY design consideration for the network architecture?

A) Bandwidth requirements for vMotion traffic  
B) Latency between sites for synchronous replication  
C) GDPR compliance for data sovereignty  
D) MPLS configuration for NSX-T overlay  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** GDPR compliance requires data sovereignty considerations, which may restrict where European data can be processed and stored, fundamentally impacting the network and replication design.

**Study Tip:** Focus on understanding the "why" behind each design decision, not just the "what." The architect exam tests your ability to make appropriate design choices based on requirements and constraints.
